    <p>This past year the Key Club at my school, St. Joseph Central Catholic High School, had a wonderful year of service. Key Club is one of the most prominent clubs in my school and is the only club that emphasizes the importance of community service. Our officers during this past year were Beth Sutfin, President; Austin Ferguson, Vice President; Joe Chirico, Treasurer; and Dominique Neff, Secretary. Our Faculty Advisor was Mrs. Meredith Mullins. &nbsp;Under their leadership and guidance, we had some services projects that helped the community greatly, but there were three services projects that were above the rest: our UNICEFF fundraiser, Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Project, and the Ronald McDonald House.</p>
    <p>Our UNICEFF fundraiser was most likely the funniest and most successful project we had this Key Club year. As a club, we wanted to raise the most amount of money we could to eliminate maternal/neonatal tetanus. We did exactly that. As not only a club but a school, we created the ultimate fundraiser. We held a basketball game which featured our St Joseph girls&rsquo; basketball team, the number one girls&rsquo; basketball team for Single A schools, and Huntington Prep, a pre-NBA basketball academy which has the number one recruit in the nation, Andrew Wiggins, as a member. They created mixed teams between the two groups and held a basketball game that was unlike any other. We opened the doors to the public, invited the local media, and brought awareness to the horrors of maternal/neonatal tetanus. At the end of the night, we raised $1,100 to help 612 women and their children, but we didn&rsquo;t just stop at UNICEFF and The Eliminate Project.</p>
    <p>Changing the lives of women overseas wasn&rsquo;t our only focus. We turned also to the children and families of West Virginia. To help brighten some little faces, we decided to throw the children staying at the local children&rsquo;s hospital and Ronald McDonald House parties. At our local Ronald McDonald House, we threw a taco party for the children and families staying there. At our local children&rsquo;s hospital, we threw a Valentine&rsquo;s Day party. We brought some cheer to these children and their families by simply cooking them a meal, playing games, and spending time talking to them. Coming up in the next couple of days we will be going back to the local Ronald McDonald House and throwing an Italian party!</p>
    <p>This upcoming year, we are hoping for another great year with the help of our new officers and adviser: Joe Chirico, President; Zoe Setser, Vice President; Caitlin Vanston, Treasurer; Sarah Mays, Secretary; Grace Linz, Bulletin Editor; and Mrs. Meredith Mullins, Faculty Advisor.</p>
