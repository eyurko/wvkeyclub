    <h2>That&rsquo;s Great and All, but WHAT IS KEY CLUB?</h2>
    <p>Key Club International is a student-led high school service organization designed to promote leadership and provide opportunities for service while building character in its members. With over 5,000 clubs and 260,000 members in 30 countries, it really is an international organization!</p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>Key Club is divided into four levels—the International Level, which is guided and run by the Key Club International Board and International President and Vice President. International is then subdivided into 33 organized districts (and one district-in-formation) which are headed up by the District Governor and his or her District Board of Trustees. From the district level multiple divisions are formed, each headed by a Lieutenant Governor (who is a member of the District Board). Then, in each division there are one or more clubs which will have a Club President and officers to run the meetings. Most important out of all of these is the individual member—YOU! Without each Key Club member, none of Key Club International could function. This is because each member pays dues to Key Club International, split into District and International Dues. District dues help pay for the District Board meetings and District Convention, whereas international dues go to International Board/International Council (the IBoard and the District Governors) meetings and International Convention. For more information, please visit the <a href="Dues.html">dues page</a>.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Key Club was started in 1925 in Sacramento, California. Two local Kiwanians (members of Kiwanis, Key Club&rsquo;s parent organization—a service organization for adults) who worked at Sacramento High School were interested in testing out a &ldquo;junior service club&rdquo; for what would be known as &ldquo;key individuals&rdquo; in their school.  The first group of young men to join (Key Club, like Kiwanis, was originally all-male) attended luncheons where various speakers would come to lecture on different jobs.  Key Club members would also attend meetings of the sponsoring Kiwanis Club in order to connect with leading professionals in their communities. As the number of young men in this new club grew, the purpose began to shift toward a service-oriented club for any of the boys in the school to join. The club began expanding socially to complement its service as well. As this club became more popular, other Kiwanis Clubs in other areas began to create their own clubs patterned off of this model.<br />
      As more and more Key Clubs came into existence, they began to meet and exchange ideas and service projects, much as we do today at our Fall Rally, District Convention, and International Convention.  Florida took the initiative and in 1939 came up with a plan to organize all the Key Clubs in Florida under the banner of a State Association of Key Clubs. After their first convention that year, they worked to adopt bylaws and 7 years later became the first Key Club District. That same year, Key Club became a truly International Organization with the formation of the first Canadian Club. Later years would hold the establishment of a Key Club Office in Kiwanis International and the inclusion of girls in Key Club. Later the West Virginia District would be established in 1944, bringing us the District we currently have today. With such a proud past and a bright future, Key Clubbers can look forward to the many years of growth in store for our grand organization.</p>
    <h3>Service</h3>
    <p>Key Club would not be a proper Kiwanis Service Leadership Program (the name given to Kiwanis-sponsored organizations) if it were not for its service aspect. In fact, Key Club&rsquo;s vision is &ldquo;[to] develop competent, capable, and caring leaders through the vehicle of service.&rdquo; So the various clubs conduct a variety of service projects throughout the year. Some play bingo with the elderly, some go clean up trash, and some even hold benefit concerts. However, the West Virginia District also sponsors some projects that it invites clubs to work on throughout the year and rewards them for their success. The District Project, a yearly project adopted by the West Virginia District, is often one of the most popular projects.  For more information, please visit the District Project Page here. Also, the Every Child a Swimmer Program is designed to help reduce drowning deaths by teaching children to swim. More information on that can be found here. The Special Activities Director is also a resource for a wide variety of special and unique projects, and her page is located here. Even the Governor gets a special project—the Governor&rsquo;s Project—that is a hand-picked initiative on some service-related interest of the Governor.  If you are looking for more information on that, either click here or check the sidebar under &ldquo;Service&rdquo;. Key Club also partners with various organizations for service, such as UNICEF, March of Dimes, and the Children&rsquo;s Miracle network, known jointly as our Preferred Charities, and the International Board chooses a Major Emphasis Program (MEP) to go with the current Theme, &ldquo;Children: Their Future, Our Focus&rdquo;. With such a wide variety of organizations to serve (including their home communities), no club is ever at a loss for a good project.</p>
    <h3> Social Activities</h3>
      Key Club, while being a service organization, is also an organization devoted to creating leaders and providing fun opportunities to grow and build character. One of the ways Key Clubbers can get out and meet other Key Clubbers is at the various conventions held throughout the year. Each has its own page if you would like more information: Key Club International Convention, The West Virginia District Fall Rally, and West Virginia&rsquo;s District Convention. Aside from those, Key Clubbers are also welcome and encouraged to attend the various Kiwanis Conventions, such as their annual District Convention (separate from the Key Club&rsquo;s) and their Mid-Year Conference. All the branches of the Kiwanis Family meet in Black Mountain, North Carolina for the annual Kiwanis Family Conference, where Key Clubbers learn team building and group leadership exercises alongside Kiwanians and Circle-K members (the college level Key Club). Interactions with Kiwanians and other service organization leaders are a very important aspect of Key Club, as they teach youth how to be comfortable around adults and allow them to connect with professionals in their area. In fact, the West Virginia District has sponsored a program to encourage the parents of Key Clubbers to join, affectionately known as the &ldquo;Parents: Buddy and Join&rdquo; or PB&amp;J program. Through these social activities, the youth in Key Club grow and mature as they are exposed to the world outside of high school. In fact, even after high school there are still ways to serve. By registering for the new Key Club Alumni Association, former Key Club members can be notified of various projects in their area and other Kiwanis Family organizations that they can join, including Circle-K and Kiwanis. Through these various social functions, Key Clubbers learn how to interact with people they may not know and get more comfortable working in groups and speaking in front of other people. Such growth may find them vying for a position at the Club, District, or International level, and we would love to have those leaders.<br/></p>
