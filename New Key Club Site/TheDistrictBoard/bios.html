                <p>Hello! My name is Haden Kersting and I am serving as the Governor of the West Virginia District of Key Club International for 2012-2013! This position entails presiding over the West Virginia District Board of Trustees. During the course of the year, we hold four board meetings during which the District Board makes decisions and reports on progress that will affect clubs across the state. I also have the responsibility of keeping in contact with the Kiwanis District, Key Club International, and all the presidents in West Virginia. This year we are continuing to strive for 1,700 members and we aim to build or reactivate 5 new clubs! We also aim to have 5 new clubs at Fall Rally and District Convention and 50 more people at District Convention. I believe this increased attendance will further promote the things about Key Club that so many already love - the fun and caring students and the united mission of service, character building, and leadership development.  If you or your club has any questions or if you need assistance with anything, I encourage you to reach out to me. My email address is <a href="mailto:wvkcgovernor@gmail.com" target="_blank">wvkcgovernor@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                <p>I am a senior at Notre Dame High School in Clarksburg, WV where I live. In addition to Key Club I am part of the National Honor Society and the Robert C. Byrd High School show choir Radiant Rhythm. I also sing in the Chanticleer Children's Chorus of West Virginia. My free time consists mostly of talking with friends and singing and listening to music around my house.</p>
                <p>I am motivated to support all the Key Clubs in West Virginia throughout the school year and I am excited to make more connections! If you are a Key Clubber in West Virginia, I hope to see you at Fall Rally in November! Again, please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you! </p></p>

				<h4>Secretary-Treasurer Jennifer Mangano</h4></a>
                <p>Hi! My name is Jennifer Mangano, and I am the District Secretary-Treasurer. My job is to track and report on the status of dues being paid in the district. My goal this year is to have all of the West Virginia clubs' dues paid on time so there are no suspensions or deactivations in the district. If you need anything, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:wvkctreasurer@comcast.net">wvkctreasurer@comcast.net</a>. I am currently a senior at Oak Glen High School where I play soccer. My favorite thing about Key Club is that it allows its members' dedication to service to benefit not only their communities, but the world as well.</p>

<p>When I'm not in school, I am usually playing soccer or reading. One of my favorite things to do is go out with my friends. We usually go to Pittsburgh because it's so close to my hometown, Chester, in the northern panhandle. I'm so thrilled to be part of the 2012-2013 District Board because I know it is going to be a great year!</p>

                <p>Greetings! My name is James Jesmer. I am serving as the 2012-2013 District Bulletin Editor of the West Virginia District of Key Club International. My job is to write and compile the district Key Club bulletin known as the Key Connection, which is sent out with all school mailings. My goal for this year is to create an interesting and informative bulletin that everyone will enjoy reading. If you need anything, have a suggestion for an article you want to see, or simply wish to submit an article of your own, I can be reached at <a href="mailto:wvkceditor@gmail.com" target="_blank">wvkceditor@gmail.com</a>. Right now, I am a senior at Bridgeport High School. This will be my third year on the swim team there and my fourth swim season on the local YMCA team. Beyond school, Key Club, and swimming, one of my favorite things to do is to draw and paint. My favorite thing about Key Club is the people you meet while serving your community. These people may be the ones you are helping or even students that you are serving with. I cannot thank Key Club enough for the individuals I have met and the friends I have made in these wonderful years of service. I cannot wait to see all of you at Fall Rally and District Convention!</p></p>

My job in the District is mainly to assist Haden in anything that he needs but also to grade the monthly newsletters and give Governor Haden the newsletter reports each month. If you need anything from me, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:wvkcgaa@gmail.com" target="_blank">wvkcgaa@gmail.com</a>. I am currently a junior at Notre Dame High School in Clarksburg.

If you were to ask me what my favorite thing about Key Club is, I'd say that I love the chance to meet new people and being able to serve others! Key Club makes it fun to do service projects and I like that it gets high school kids involved in their community.</p>
                 <p>Outside of school, I love to read and spend time with friends and family. During the summer a lot of time is spent poolside and relaxing. During school I can usually be found studying or hanging out with my friends. I love listening to music and watching movies as well!</p></p>

Anyways, I'm so honored to have this opportunity this year and am excited to fulfill my goals to the best of my ability! I can't wait to meet you all at the conventions!</p></p>

                <p>I go to St. Joseph Central Catholic High School and I'm in my senior year. My favorite part about Key Club is that it's an International Organization and that means what we do has a global impact on our world for the better. My life outside of school consists of working at my day job and doing different forms of service in my community. When I'm trying to have fun I go and hang with a few different friends or I go and watch a movie several different times in the theaters. I live in my home town of Huntington, West Virginia, which means I'm a big Herd Fan. I'm completely excited for this upcoming year of service and can't wait to see all of you Key Clubbers at Fall Rally and District Convention!</p></p>
