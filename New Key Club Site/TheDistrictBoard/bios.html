                <p>Hey Fellow Key Clubbers!  My name is Katarina Alatis, and I am the 2013-2014 West Virginia Secretary-Treasurer. My job is to make sure there is constant communication among the district, divisions, and the International Level. I am responsible for all of the records in the district, and I track and report the status of dues being paid in the district. My goal for this year is to make our district strong. With the help of the District Board, I want to make sure the clubs who have not paid their dues from the previous year pay them before October 1st, so they will not become inactive, have clubs pay dues on time, and begin reactivating the 10 clubs who are inactive. If you need anything this year feel free to contact me! <a href="mailto:wvkcsectreas@gmail.com">wvkcsectreas@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>I am currently a senior at Weir High School located in Division 1, and my favorite part about Key Club is the opportunities you are given through this amazing organization. With Key Club, you get to make so many life- long friendships while making an impact at the same time. Apart from Key Club, my free time consists of talking to friends, watching movies, and spending time with my family. This is going to be a great year! I hope to see you all at Fall Rally and District Convention!</p></p>

                <p>Hello fellow Key Clubbers! I am Emily Garren, and I will be your Lieutenant Governor for Division 10A this year for 2013-2014. As Lieutenant Governor, my job is to be the line of communication between the clubs and the district board, and my goal this year is to improve the involvement in the clubs in Division 10A.

<p>I am currently a senior at St. Joseph Central Catholic High School, and I plan on studying to become a nurse practitioner. I am involved in many clubs and organizations at my school, but Key Club is definitely my favorite club that I am a part of. I enjoy Key Club because it brings together kids who are my age that are excited to serve. Outside of school, I am heavily involved in music; I currently play and take lessons with my oboe and guitar. If I am not playing music, I am either reading, writing, or watching my favorite television show, The Office. I am looking forward to having a great Key Club year!</p></p>

<p>I am a senior at St. Joseph Central Catholic High School in Huntington, but I live across the river in Chesapeake, Ohio. Besides Key Club, I am a dedicated fine arts student and hope to pursue fine arts as a career in life. I also am club president of Venturing Crew, in National Honor Society, in Mu Alpha Theta, and in Latin Club.  While I enjoy these other extracurriculars, Key Clubs is what's most special to me. I truly love the friendships we make with other people who love to serve as much as we do.</p>

<p>Outside of school and Key Club, I love to spend time and act silly with my family and friends.  I can often be found camping, whitewater rafting, or kayaking.  I also love going to music concerts or just sitting in my room and listening to the Avett Brothers.  I am beyond excited for this year, and I hope to see you at Fall Rally and District Convention!</p></p>

<p>I will be going into my senior year at Weir High School of Weirton, West Virginia this fall. I participate in cheering, track, gymnastics. I am also involved in some clubs at my school, one of the most important ones being Key Club of course. If anyone were to ask me what my favorite thing about Key Club is, I would have to say how accepting everyone is of everyone else. Throughout my years in this extraordinary club, I have never witnessed anyone judging someone else. I absolutely love the welcoming and friendly atmosphere that is present at all events in which Key Club is involved. Outside of school, I am usually at some type of practice, involved in a Key Club event, or spending time with friends and family.</p>
<p>I am so excited to serve the great West Virginia Key Club District this year! I have high hopes for the entire Kiwanis family as well. I am especially looking forward to meeting and working with the exceptional members!</p></p>

                <p>Hey Key Clubbers! My name is Sean Snider, and I'm the Presidents' Liaison of  West Virginia District of Key Club International. I act as a source of communication between the District Board and Club Presidents around the state. This year, I would like to set up an email group between all presidents to facilitate discussion and ease the burden of being a club president. If you want to talk to me directly, my email is <a href="mailto:wvkcpresidentsliaison@gmail.com" target="_blank">wvkcpresidentsliaison@gmail.com</a>. This year I will be a senior at Parkersburg High School. I also participate in multiple other clubs, including Quiz Bowl, Mu Alpha Theta, Physics Club, and Young Republicans. I am also a member of my school's swimming and cross country teams. My favorite thing about Key Club is seeing the look on peoples' faces when you truly make a difference in their lives. Outside of school, pretty much all I do is swim. I swim for the Parkersburg YMCA, and normally practice 3-4 hours a day. For fun, I really enjoy playing ultimate frisbee. I can't wait for this year! I hope we can do great things!</p></p>
