            	<h4>Divisions 5&6 Lieutenant Governor Harry Gilbert Neidig IV</h4></a>
                    <p>Hello fellow servants.  I'm Harry Neidig IV and I'm your Lieutenant Governor of divisions 5 & 6.  Other than Key Club, I participate in several extracurricular activities.  Such as, Ultimate Frisbee club (and in general because I love it.), a prayer group at my school, Student Government, Chamber Child, and 4 youth groups (while leading worship in one.) But none of these activities compare to the experiences I have with my family!  While being the oldest of 8 kids is an awesome thing, it also yields many responsibility and likewise many rewards.  It was a combination of all of these groups that led me to Key Club, and service in general.  My family makes many sacrifices for me to be with you all, but we both know its worth it in the end.  Thanks for reading my story, and God Bless!</p>

                <p>
I am Shade Varney, the new Lieutenant Governor of District 7A, but I am no "shadey" character when it comes to helping others. I really love being able to assist people though Key Club or through volunteering at the Department of Veteran Affairs, but I also love football and sciences. The San Francisco 49ers are my favorite team and any science (with the exception of natural selection) is interesting to me. I'm not where I am now to teach you about astrophysics or show you clips from Super Bowl XXIII. I am here to improve our connection with District Board. I hope to bring our Clubs closer together through inter-club projects. Remember I am here to be the voice for each of you. Feel free to contact me at any time if you have questions. Let's have a great year together. Email me at <a href="mailto:wvkcltg7a@gmail.com" target="_blank">wvkcltg7@gmail.com</a>.</p></p>

                <p>Hi! My name is Amanda Barrett, and i am the Lieutenant Governor for Division 7B for the 2014-2015 year. I will be responsible for overseeing and helping the Key Clubs within my division. I hope to build and train them to better serve our community. My goal is to get the word out and attract new members to existing clubs and to also start new clubs in schools that do not yet have one. I am a senior at Princeton Senior High School located in Princeton, WV. Besides Key Club, I do soccer, track, cross country, and participate in National Honor's Society (NHS) as well as Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA). I really enjoy Key Club because you make new friends while having fun serving the community.</p>
<p>Outside of school I play on a travel soccer team 3 out of the 4 seasons. I am also heavily active in my youth group at church as we reach out to our local and world community. I plan on attending Liberty University in the Fall of 2015. I am a firm believer in setting goals and working hard to achieve them. I hope I can meet you one day at Fall Rally or DCON and look forward to this year! Please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:wvkcltg8@gmail.com" target="_blank">wvkcltg8@gmail.com</a>.</p></p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Mary Shephard and I am Lieutenant Governor for division 8. In this position, I will be communicating with the clubs in my division and making sure everything is going smoothly. My goal for this Key Club year is to help my neighboring clubs grow. I want them to get as excited about service as I am.</p>
<p>I will be going into my junior year at Bluefield High School.  In addtion to Key Club, I participate in Debate club and FCA. Key Club, of course, is my favorite part about school. My favorite part about Key Club is knowing you helped someone. At the end of the day, that's all that matters.
