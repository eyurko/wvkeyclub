    <p>Have you enjoyed being a member of your high school Key Club? Do you want to experience the next level of Key Club? Then consider becoming a member of the District Board. The District Board consists of the Governor, the Executive Committee, the Lieutenant Governors, and the Committee Chairs. These positions are elected or appointed at the West Virginia District Convention. Candidates are usually nominated before the convention starts. While at the convention, candidates must present their ideas and answer questions from fellow Key Clubbers during division caucuses. These candidates are then voted on by delegates during the House of Delegates session for the upcoming year.</p>
    <h4>The Executive Committee</h4>
    <p>The Executive District Board includes the offices of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Governor</li>
      <li>Secretary</li>
      <li>Treasurer</li>
      <li>District Editor</li>
      <li>Governor's Administrative Assistant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Governor, Secretary and Treasurer are elected positions while the District Editor and the Governor's Administrative Assistant are appointed positions. Candidates must either file the proper paperwork before the District Convention starts or be nominated for the office at Opening Session during the Convention. The district is legislated by a representative democracy structured government. Headed by the district Governor, the other district Officers and the Lieutenant Governors who, together, make up the District Board. The board is responsible for running all district programs and events as well as developing policy in compliance with Key Club International bylaws. A prescribed number of board meetings, usually including those held at the initial district convention, and concluding district convention, are held during the Key Club term of one year.</p>
    <h4>The Lieutenant Governors</h4>
    <p>A Lieutenant Governor is elected to lead and represent each of the divisions in a district. Candidates are nominated by clubs in their home division. Each candidate is introduced and presents their goals for Key Club during division caucuses at the District Convention. The candidates then attend the House of Delegates session and again present their goals. Selected delegates and board members vote for the best candidate for the upcoming year. The Lieutenant Governor serves as a liaison between the clubs in their division and the district board. They must also visit each of their clubs, publish a monthly divisional newsletter, hold a monthly Divisional Council Meeting, and contact their clubs, district executive board, and Kiwanis Clubs. In addition, a Lieutenant Governor may initiate community service projects to help the members become more involved. The Lieutenant Governor is responsible for oversight of four to sixteen high school Key Clubs.</p>
    <h4>Committee Chairs</h4>
    <p>If you are interested in an appointed position, you must send a letter of intention to the Governor and Administrator in January or February for a review and possible interview process, and you need to fill out the Appointed Chair Application Form on <a href="/nav/ForYourClub/Forms.html">this page</a>.
